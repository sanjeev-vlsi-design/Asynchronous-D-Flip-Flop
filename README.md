# Asynchronous-D-Flip-Flop
Asynchronous D Flip-Flop

This repository contains the design, implementation, and testing of an Asynchronous D Flip-Flop using Verilog. The project is aimed at demonstrating the principles of sequential digital logic design, specifically focusing on asynchronous reset functionality.

Overview

The D Flip-Flop is one of the fundamental building blocks in digital systems, commonly used for data storage and synchronization. This project extends the functionality by implementing an asynchronous reset, allowing the flip-flop to reset its state regardless of the clock signal.

Features

Asynchronous Reset: The flip-flop can reset immediately upon receiving a reset signal, independent of the clock.

Parameterized Design: Supports flexible configurations for simulation and testing.

Fully Testbenched: Includes testbenches to validate functionality under various conditions.

Synthesis-Ready: Designed for synthesis and implementation in FPGAs or ASICs
